A Quadrature Down Converter is a device that takes up an input signal and modulates it with two sinusoidal waves with a phase difference of 90$^\circ$ and high frequency to prepare it for transmission. We take the input signal to two mixers, where mixer 1 multiplies the input signal with the in-phase component of the quadrature oscillator and mixer 2 multiplies the input signal with the quadrature phase component of the carrier signal and then they are passed with a low pass filter. The circuit consists of three major circuit blocks. A quadrature oscillator, a signal mixer and a low pass filter.
