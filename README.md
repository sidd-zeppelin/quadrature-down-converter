# Quadrature Down Converter

For our course  EC2.103 Analog Electronics Circuits in our institute, International Institute of Information Technology under our Professor Dr. Zia Abbas, we were tasked to design and implement our own design of a Quadrature down converter, a circuit system that plays a vital role in communications.


A quadrature down-converter is essential in communication systems for converting RF signals to baseband while preserving phase and amplitude information. The design typically includes:

Local Oscillator (LO): Generates a sinusoidal signal at a specified frequency.

Quadrature Generator (90° Phase Shifter): Produces two LO signals 90° apart (cosine and sine).

Mixers (Multipliers): Mix the input RF signal with both LO signals to extract the I and Q components.

Low-Pass Filters: Remove high-frequency components from the mixer outputs, isolating the baseband signals.

The project paper named as "The_Quadrature_Down_Converter.pdf" contains in-depth report of the design procedure of the circuit made.
